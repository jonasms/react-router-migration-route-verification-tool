# react-router-migration-route-verification-tool
## How to run
```
python exec.py
```

If you want to run the _route enumeration_ step, which produces a list of routes in a given file, separately from the _generate route tree diff_ step, you can do so by running them indivdually:

```
python extract_routes.py

python diff_lists.py
```
